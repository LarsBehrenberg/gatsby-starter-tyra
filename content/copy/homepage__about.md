We want to share our experiences and knowledge with you that we have accumulated over the years about visa, traveling, insurances or just how to live overseas! We met in New Zealand and now live a travel life together moving back and forth between Asia and Europe.

We love experiencing different cultures and with this blog give you an idea of what it's like to live an intercultural traveling life!
