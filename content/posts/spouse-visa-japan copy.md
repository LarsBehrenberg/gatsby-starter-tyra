# How to get a spouse visa in Japan

### Step by Step Process:
Create List of all needed documents (see below)
Get a translated version of the Japanese partner’s Koseki Touhon with Apostille
Get a birth certificate from your country (in our case Germany, my family got it and sent it over)
Apply at the (German) consulate for the (German) marriage certificate with the obtained (German) birth certificate and the translated Koseki Touhon
Gather tax documents from either partner who is employed (as well as bank statements)
Copies of passports & a foreign partner’s residence card (approval of residential address)
Get a new Koseki Touhon that is within 3 month of application filing
Fill out the application form (8 pages) with 3 photos of the couple
Submit the folder to the immigration with all documents 



**Disclaimer:** The spouse visa is really a case by case process, but we just recently went through it and here is what we learnt. 


We got married in October 2019 (which was quite the undertaking on its own) and then set our eyes on gathering the documents in order to apply for the visa. We felt like we had a lot of leeway, because my visa was only going to expire in May 2020. But as usual in the end it all had to happen rather quickly. Our situation was a little different, because I already had a visa in Japan and we got married in Japan, so this made things a lot easier we thought. 

First off, we researched tons and came up with a list of all documents needed in order to apply for the spouse visa, having in mind the spouse visa application process would only take up to about 4-8 weeks.

**General:**
- Application Form
- Photos


**Japanese partner:**
- Koseki Touhon
- Proof of Address (住民票)
- Proof of tax
- Income tax
- Residential tax
- Personal ID (Driver’s license)
- Bank Statement (if needed)
- Apartment contract

**Foreign partner:**
- Copy of Passport
- Photo (3cm x 4cm)
- (German) marriage certificate
- Copy of Residence Card (在留カード)
- Bank Statement (if needed)



We started dividing this list into things that take long and things that would be easy to obtain. We recommend to get started with the preparation for the German marriage certificate since it can take up to 8 weeks. 
The first step for getting the German marriage document is for the Japanese partner to go get her/his Koseki Touhon from a local city office (¥450). Then, she/he needs to send or take the Koseki Touhon to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOF). In Osaka, the MOF is located in 4 Chome-1-76 Otemae, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 540-0008, Japan. I took my Koseki Touhon to the MOF (on Google maps the opening hours is stated as until 17:00 but you are required to enter the building by 16:30), where I asked for Apostille. The earliest they can get it back to you is the following day. Otherwise you have a choice to buy a letter pack (¥350) from the convenience store within the same building of MOF and send your own Koseki Touhon with Apostille to yourself or in our case, we send it directly to the translator (you need to find your own translator, who is officially approved for Apostille translations, the consulate/embassy in Osaka can provide you a list of the translators in your area). 

While waiting for the Apostille translation, it might be a good idea to have your (German) birth certificate being sent from Germany to Japan. So once it arrives, you can go with both documents, the translated Japanese marriage certificate with Apostille & the (German) birth certificate, to the consulate/embassy to apply for the German marriage certificate. This might take again up to 4 weeks. In our case, we were going to visit family in Germany and would have got the (German) marriage certificate there instead of having to apply at the consulate/embassy in Osaka. 

So far, we are 8 weeks in but we are still only working on one document.

At this stage, we were worried about our financial means and whether that would affect our visa application, as we had read a lot about it on the internet. So we contacted a visa specialised lawyer in Osaka to get some advice. The lawyer at first was very confident and told us that there would be no problem at all to get the visa. However, after some explaining, she quickly realised that not because of our financial means/savings, but because we are both not employed full-time at the moment in Japan, we would almost surely be denied. That was crushing. 

The lawyer said that without a monthly full-time income (at least ¥200,000/month) for at least 3 consecutive months, meaning a full-time employment in Japan, it is almost impossible to get a spouse visa. She was very confident that if one of us would pick up a full-time employment, we would not have a problem getting a spouse visa. 

In the end, we decided to save our chance for another time. Going through this process, we really learned two things. The documents needed for the application change a lot depending on your situation. Whether the foreign partner lives in Japan or overseas, whether you got married in Japan or overseas, whether you might go home after getting married in Japan, you might end up needing different documents than we did. Visa lawyers in Japan often have a free counselling for the first time which can help a lot if you don’t know where to start. 

Secondly being employed in Japan. We thought savings would be enough to prove that we would be able support ourselves while living in Japan, but we were wrong. After reading a lot about other cases like ours and listening to the visa lawyer, it seems like having an employment really matters.

Long story short, if you are employed in Japan, have some savings, both already live in Japan, you will have a decent chance to get the visa. Just make sure to start early on the process while the foreign partner still lives in Japan. It makes things a lot easier.
