**Our Comment:**

‘CaféBibliotic Hello!’ is one of the most well-known and popular cafes in Kyoto. We believe that it is because of the interior of the café. When you go inside, it feels like you are at an old library, as there are a lot of books against the wall. You will find some interesting books on the book shelves. The café has an unique atmosphere and it changes from lunch time to the evening. There is also a bakery right next door (connected to the café) and you can order some bread from the bakery and eat at the café. They offer pretty good hand drip coffee but take some time before they can bring your orders. The café is located in a quite busy area of Kyoto, between Marutamachi and Karasuma-oike stations. There is an upstairs seating area too but it is quite limited so if you go at busy lunch time, it is less likely that you will get these seats. So we suggest you to avoid busy lunch hours if you want to relax there. If you are looking for an unique café to try some bread while reading books, we recommend Café Bibliotic Hello!
