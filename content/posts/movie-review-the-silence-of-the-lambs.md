**Our Comment:**

The overall rating for this movie was close to 10/10! The unique and unforeseeable storyline kept us being excited for the entire film. The excellent camera work and brilliant performance by the actors/actresses added extra points to the film. There were quite a lot of blood and uncomfortable images so we don’t recommend this film to children and young adolescents. However, it is one of the movies we rate highly and recommend people to watch once in a life time. Watch it with friends and family and a heart-warming hot chocolate if you are not a big fan of horrors.
