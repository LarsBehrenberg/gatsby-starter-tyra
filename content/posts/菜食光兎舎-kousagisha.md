**Our Comment:**

This vegan restaurant, ‘Kousagisha’looks like a designer shop or some sort of a fancy store from outside. It is quite small so it is better to make a reservation if you are going there at lunch time. The restaurant offers two different lunch menu, Today’s special lunch plate (¥1,900) or Today’s curry plate (¥1,500). The owners use local rice and vegetables and water comes from a well. They take time to serve the best quality food for each customer so it takes some time for you to get your orders but it is so worth it. We tried the special lunch plate a couple of times. It may not be the cheapest lunch option around Kyoto but the lunch plate they offer is something special and you will not find this anywhere else. The lunch and the healthy charcoal smoothie were both very delicious. We had not had such smoothie before. The owners are a friendly couple but they don’t often have time to chat with customers so long, as they prepare and cook food from the scratch on their own. We highly recommend Kousagisha, if you are into tasty natural food and unique flavours of smoothies. There is no parking so you will need to find your own coin parking nearby.
