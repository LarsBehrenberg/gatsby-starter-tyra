**Our Comment:**

This vegan restaurant, ‘Kousagisha' offers amazing lunch. All the food on the menu is hand made from the scratch with nutritious vegetables! The cafe building looks like a designer shop or some sort of a fancy store from outside.  It is quite small so it is better to make a reservation if you are going there at lunch time. We were   lucky to find seats without a reservation! But you better not risk it, as the cafe only offers limited number of seats and lunch, too. \
The restaurant offers two types lunch menu, Today’s special lunch plate (¥1,900) and Today’s curry plate (¥1,500). The owners use local rice and vegetables and water comes from a well. Did you hear that?! Yes, they get water from a well!! Wow, what an effort! When you go there, you can tell that they put a lot of effort and take time to serve the best quality food for each customer. You will need to be patient to get your orders but it is worth the wait. We tried the special lunch plate a couple of times. It may not be the cheapest lunch option around Kyoto but the lunch plate they offer is something very special and you will not find this anywhere else. Another word, you can't put a price on it. The lunch and the healthy charcoal smoothie were both very delicious and quite unique! Yes, you read it right, charcoal smoothie! That's not something you would find at Satrbucks, right? We had not had such smoothie before. \
The owners are a friendly couple but they don’t often have time to chat with customers so long, as they prepare and cook food from the scratch on their own. We highly recommend Kousagisha, if you are into tasty natural food and unique flavours of smoothies. \
By the way, there is no parking so you will need to find your own coin parking nearby.
