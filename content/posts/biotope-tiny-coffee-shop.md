**Our Comment:**

Biotope tiny coffee shop looks like a flower shop from outside. It is tinny and such a cute café. The owners are a friendly couple. They made us delicious hand drip coffee. We were the only customers at the beginning so we were able to have a nice chat about the café with them. They opened the café in 2019 so when we went there, it was still a few months since they had opened it. We liked the interior design and interesting corner shaped café. This café is quite unique in a way that you forget that you are sitting on the side of the main road. There are a lot of plants and green leaves so you instantly feel refreshment when you enter the cafe. It is located in Kamigyo-ward of Kyoto. If you want to try out a new café, we recommend Biotope tiny coffee shop.
