**Our Comment:**

Café Timedou is nice and peaceful although it is right by Karasuma subway station. The cafe is located by the Imperial Palace, and just a 5min walk from the subway station. The shop has two stories and the second floor is a gallery, in which you will see beautiful mugs and bowls. We found a mug that we liked a lot and was also used to serve our coffee in the cafe downstairs. \
The staff is amazingly welcoming at the cafe. When we were about to leave the cafe, it started raining heavily and they let us sit down and wait for the rain to stop. They were all very relaxed and we felt comfortable chilling inside. We hope you feel comfortable, too when you go there. \
The café has a mixture of wester and Japanese style food/drink menu. For example, there were a lot of macha sweets and drinks but also ice cream and other cakes. We tried some sweets and we liked the macha flavour a lot so we ordered another one. If you are looking for a café to relax and chat with friends without noise around Karasuma area, we highly recommend Timedou café.
