## Our Comment:

This café opened 4 years ago and is run by a Japanese couple with the emphasis on a Studio Ghibli-ish style interior design.<br/><br/>
When we arrrived at 12:30pm soon after the cafe opened for the day, the lady of the café arrived just behind us in a taxi, seemingly rushed, and before we had even entered, she told us to keep quite to not disturb anyone. We didn't feel very welcomed when we entered and the lady rushed us to take our orders.<br/><br/>
The husband though was very calm and when he served us the coffee, we could feel his appreciation for us. The coffee tasted great, although only lukewarm, it wasn't outstanding for what you pay (¥600 for a blend & ~¥680 for a single origin coffee).<br/><br/>
The café itself wasn't heated, which usually isn't a huge problem, as long as the coffee is warm... The atmosphere inside the café did feel cold, as we were told not to speak out loud, even though there were really no other guests. If the staff was more welcoming, surely the overall atmosphere of the café would have been nicer. In the end we paid ¥600 each for a decent taste, but cold coffee and left after 20mins 'cause of the quite unwelcoming atmosphere. We rarely say this, but we wouldn't recommend this place. It might have been that the café lady was just having a bad day though.<br/><br/>
Another inconvenience was that inside the café you aren't really allowed to take any photos as well as there is no car or bicycle parking... So I guess you can only walk there?
