**Our Comment:**

Goodman Roaster Kyotoroasts their own coffee beans as the name of the café tells us. When you walk pass the café, the awesome smell of the coffee invites you to the inside. The layout the café is pretty cool, too, as there are some window seats, table seats and some couches. The atmosphere is relaxing and calm. The coffee is so good! They also offer almond and soy milk as well as some vegan sweets. It is good for vegan customers. You can taste a difference in your coffee. The barista takes some time to prepare each coffee one by one and it is worth the wait. I ordered almond café latte and it was one of the best almond latte in a long time. The owners are friendly and very relaxed. We highly recommend Goodman Roaster Kyoto, if you are looking for delicious coffee around Kawaramachi area. There is no parking so you will need to find your own coin parking nearby but there are bicycle parking areas in front of the café.
